# About Me:

Hello! My name is Jared Summers. I am currently in college attempting to get my associates in Game Programming. I am currently learning more about the unity engine and how to develop games in it as well as taking advanced Java and C++ courses. Things I do during my free time include playing billiards, reading, and gaming.
